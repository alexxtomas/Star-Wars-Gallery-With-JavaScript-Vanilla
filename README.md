# Star-Wars-Gallery-With-JavaScript-Vanilla

It's so easy create a very basic web application when you dominate some frameworks/libaries.
Why that I decide to create a  Star Wars gallery where you can filter by planet and
name without any libary or framework. 
This project is with only JavaScript Vanilla, the only dependencies intalled are linter, and json-server. 
The next challenge was create a repsonive web application without flex or grid, and I think I have succeeded.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
